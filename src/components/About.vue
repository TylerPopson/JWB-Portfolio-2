                Jordan Burger is an audio engineer from Greenville, IN who loves
                spending every day making, recording, and mixing music of all
                kinds with all kinds of people. Based out of Louisville, KY,
                Jordan is happy to be recording musicians from all over the
                world! Jordan's life has always been surrounded by music, with a
                background of playing cello and upright bass for orchestras and
                choral singing. Jordan was also entrenched in the musical
                theatre scene, which eventually led him to the theatrical audio
                scene, and he began mixing and designing for live theatre. The
                thrill of mixing live music led to the studio world, where
                Jordan fell in love with the recording arts. At the Indiana
                University Jacobs School of Music, Jordan earned his B.S. in
                Audio Engineering and Sound Production, where he recorded and
                reinforced music across all genres and time periods from
                symphony orchestras to punk bands. Jordan loves all kinds of
                music, but is especially fond of prog, rock, showtunes, and
                anything with a jazz influence. More than anything though,
                Jordan loves meeting new people and bringing their music to life
                to share with the world. Recently, Jordan has made a name for
                himself recording and mixing A Cappella music with recent
                releases by Hooshir A Cappella and Resting Pitch Face, which is
                music he is especially fond of from his time as a choir singer
                and as a member of the Grammy nominated Singing Hoosiers. Jordan
                canâ€™t wait to meet you and help you record your next big
                project!
